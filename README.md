18 year old cat.
I have nothing to say other than the fact that I have nothing to say making me say something which isn't nothing as I said before.
## Programming history
My first steps were in Scratch, in 2015 (8yo), mostly consisting of minigames but also a few math and geometry concepts.
I started actual programming during summer 2020 (13yo) in Python. First project was a Pong game (same summer).
## Languages
I have decent experience with various languages.
Python is the language I know the best. I've used Java quite a bit. Also had to manipulate Javascript a few times, though I'm not a great fan. I'm learning C (coded in D a bit too) and OCaml, which might be my favourite. Incorporated PHP in one project and I really enjoyed the concept. I have basic understanding of Pascal scripts.
## Best projects
I've pinned my best projects on my Github page.
